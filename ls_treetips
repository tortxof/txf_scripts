# This script lists all directories that don't have sub-directories.
# First, find lists all directories with 2 links. The two links are from the parent directory and '.' inside the directory itself.
# If a directory has any sub-directories, it will have more than 2 links because of the '..' in the sub-directory.
# grep is used to filter out the .git directory if you use this in a repo.
# The while read loop echos each line minus the leading './'.
# Finally, the results are sorted.
